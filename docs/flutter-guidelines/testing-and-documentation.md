# Testing and Documentation

## Testing
* **Running Tests:** To run tests, use the `run_tests` tool if it is available,
  otherwise use `flutter test`.
* **Unit Tests:** Use `package:test` for unit tests.
* **Widget Tests:** Use `package:flutter_test` for widget tests.
* **Integration Tests:** Use `package:integration_test` for integration tests.
* **Assertions:** Prefer using `package:checks` for more expressive and readable
  assertions over the default `matchers`.

### Testing Best practices
* **Convention:** Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert (or Given-When-Then) pattern.
* **Unit Tests:** Write unit tests for domain logic, data layer, and state
  management.
* **Widget Tests:** Write widget tests for UI components.
* **Integration Tests:** For broader application validation, use integration
  tests to verify end-to-end user flows.
* **integration_test package:** Use the `integration_test` package from the
  Flutter SDK for integration tests. Add it as a `dev_dependency` in
  `pubspec.yaml` by specifying `sdk: flutter`.
* **Mocks:** Prefer fakes or stubs over mocks. If mocks are absolutely
  necessary, use `mockito` or `mocktail` to create mocks for dependencies. While
  code generation is common for state management (e.g., with `freezed`), try to
  avoid it for mocks.
* **Coverage:** Aim for high test coverage.


## Documentation

* **`dartdoc`:** Write `dartdoc`-style comments for all public APIs.


### Documentation Philosophy

* **Comment wisely:** Use comments to explain why the code is written a certain
  way, not what the code does. The code itself should be self-explanatory.
* **Document for the user:** Write documentation with the reader in mind. If you
  had a question and found the answer, add it to the documentation where you
  first looked. This ensures the documentation answers real-world questions.
* **No useless documentation:** If the documentation only restates the obvious
  from the code's name, it's not helpful. Good documentation provides context
  and explains what isn't immediately apparent.
* **Consistency is key:** Use consistent terminology throughout your
  documentation.

### Commenting Style

* **Use `///` for doc comments:** This allows documentation generation tools to
  pick them up.
* **Start with a single-sentence summary:** The first sentence should be a
  concise, user-centric summary ending with a period.
* **Separate the summary:** Add a blank line after the first sentence to create
  a separate paragraph. This helps tools create better summaries.
* **Avoid redundancy:** Don't repeat information that's obvious from the code's
  context, like the class name or signature.
* **Don't document both getter and setter:** For properties with both, only
  document one. The documentation tool will treat them as a single field.

### Writing Style

* **Be brief:** Write concisely.
* **Avoid jargon and acronyms:** Don't use abbreviations unless they are widely
  understood.
* **Use Markdown sparingly:** Avoid excessive markdown and never use HTML for
  formatting.
* **Use backticks for code:** Enclose code blocks in backtick fences, and
  specify the language.

### What to Document

* **Public APIs are a priority:** Always document public APIs.
* **Consider private APIs:** It's a good idea to document private APIs as well.
* **Library-level comments are helpful:** Consider adding a doc comment at the
  library level to provide a general overview.
* **Include code samples:** Where appropriate, add code samples to illustrate usage.
* **Explain parameters, return values, and exceptions:** Use prose to describe
  what a function expects, what it returns, and what errors it might throw.
* **Place doc comments before annotations:** Documentation should come before
  any metadata annotations.
